1. a) No. The bar chart does not adequately highlight
      differences in percentage since the bars are all
      about the same height; as a result, it's a poor choice.
   b) I felt that two lines would be a good way of intuitively visualizing
      two different degree types, and the percentage over time is best
      visualized as a line graph as well.

2. One possible bias is selection bias; since the data is (could be?)
   self-reported, students who did not attain a degree are less likely to
   respond to a survey that asks them if they attained one. Thus, the percentages
   may be skewed in the positive direction.

3. The dataset could be used to justify why some ethnicity is more intelligent
   than another based on the data points of how some ethnicities attain more
   degrees (by percentage) than another. A regular person would probably believe
   that this is misuse since it is a) being used to demonize/ostracize a population
   and b) inaccurate; it is assuming causation from correlation, and the dataset
   only provides correlation.
